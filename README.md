## Performing Different Clustering Algorithms for Classification of Provinces of Turkey According to Their Economic Development

Clustering is a type of unsupervised learning and it is important to understand that clustering is used not for prediction about data sets, but is used for classify the dataset according to some feature of data. There are many clustering methods that is used to see pattern of data. Main types of clustering methods are partitional clustering (k-means and PAM), hierarchical clustering, density-based clustering and fuzzy clustering. 
The main goal of this project is to see how provinces of Turkey is clustered according to their economic features and how similar provinces are from different regions and sizes. In this project, PAM and hierarchical clustering methods are used and results are compared to see how different methods use different approach. 

  ### Background Information About Dataset
  
The data set includes economic indicators for each province in Turkey. The indicators have been taken from Turkish Statistical Institute. The data is from year 2018 . All variables in this data set are numerical. It should be noted that Ä°stanbul has the highest scores in total. Because it has a very special economic and geographic situation and therefore it creates its own cluster in all clustering algorithms. The set of variables are as below: <br />
  -- Province:	The Name of the Province<br />
  -- GDP:	GDP (Thousand $)<br />
  -- Population:	Total Population<br />
  -- Export:	Total Export (Thousand $)<br />
  -- Agriculture:	Total Cultivated Agricultural Area (Hectares)<br />
  -- Overnights:	Number of Arrivals and Overnight Stays in Accommodation Facilities with Tourism Operation Certificate: Number of Overnight Stays / Total<br />
  -- Net.Migration: Net Migration of the Province<br />
  -- Cars: Number of Automobiles per Thousand People<br />
  -- Education:	Population by Educational Level (15 Years and Older), Graduates of College or Faculty / Total<br />
  -- Unemployment:	Unemployment Rate (%)
